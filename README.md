Blade styles for Proffie saber board

These go in your "config.h" file under the sound/style banks. You will need the Arduino IDE from https://www.arduino.cc/en/software to flash the board and you may also need to install Zadig (on Windows at least) from https://zadig.akeo.ie/ to make the bootloader work.

There is a guide on the subject here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHadzMT1aSk
